There are two examples of an unspeakable trauma in The Crying of Lot 49 - the death of Niccol&#243; and the unmentioned death of J.F.K.
There is also a literal trauma - Pasquale, illegitmate child of Francesca and the Duke of Faggio, ends up promised to his mother in marriage after causing his father to be killed because of Angelo's jealousy
Contrast between the train and the car
Oedipa often thinks about events in her life as those they are on rails and proceeding through a rail yard, their path predetermined by switches set by a pointsman. On other occasions, when she is searching for answers or confused, she is depicted in a car, free to take any exit available to her but bound to the roadway.
Structure of the built environment
Oedipa begins to see patterns in the suburban landscape similar to the lines on a printed circuit board, a major export of the Southern Californian industry. She also begins to imagine her world as a figment of someone's imagination, with all its unlikely links and coincidences
