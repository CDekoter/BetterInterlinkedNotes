Born in New Orleans on October 18th, 1939. (24 y.o.). Placed in an orphanage when he was three. Moved back in with his mother at 4, then bounced around the country as she got married and divorced.
Joined the United States Marine Corps in October 24th, 1956. Scored acceptably well on a marksmanship exam, trained in aviation fundamentals and radar scanning. At this time, he began to become interested in communism and wrote to several organizations, praising their cause.
After being discharged from the Marine Corps in September on account of his mother's ill health and the nearing end of his service, Oswald traveled to France, then to the U.S.S.R after visiting with his mother for only three days. He applied for Soviet citizenship but was denied. After this rejection, he allegedly attempted suicide, but was hospitalized. (I.A. - unlikely). He was granted a temporary worker's visa and moved to Minsk to work in a radio factory as an unskilled laborer. 

'One of his favourite books was George Orwell's powerfully anti-totalitarian "1984"'.

"Similarly, American officials helped Oswald and his Russian wife, Marina, when they wanted to come to the United States in 1962, because they thought it better for this country to bring a defector back." (p.xxxiii)
Forged a smallpox vaccination record with the name Dr. A.J. Hideel. As alleged by Marina, Hideel, Hidell, or other variations are an allusion to Fidel Castro's name.
In Russia, Oswald used the nickname 'Alek'.
On November 22, multiple people saw Oswald carrying a paper bag, but cannot agree to the length of the bag. There is considerable confusion as to the manner in which he held the bag. The stock of the rifle is 38" long, representing the mininum length of the bag, but multiple people claim he held it alongside his right arm and it did not reach above his shoulder. In comparing the packaged carried on the 22nd to the width it occupied in the back of his car, a witness showed that it was only 28" long. (p.126) The commission report glosses over this.
Fingerprint analysis showed that Oswald did not wear gloves while handling the bag or the rifle.
"Everybody will know who I am now." (p.151)

From his Wikipedia page: Walker, at age 66, was arrested one June 23, 1976 for fondling and propositioning a male undercover police officer in a public restroom in a Dallas park and charged with public lewdness. He was arrested again in Dallas for public lewdness on March 16, 1977. (...) He was never married and did not have any children.

LHO obtained a fake Selective Service I.D. card with the name Alek J. Hidell on it, and carried it around in his wallet up to the day of the shooting.
